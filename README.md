# Brightloop Subscriptions

> One system to run products, plans, subscriptions, recurring billing, payments and revenue reporting for a subscription business.

Built for the **Odoo x Make-A-Ton 9.0 Kochi Hackathon 2026** (virtual round, 31 October 2026).

## Problem statement

Brightloop Software earns its money every month, but runs on a spreadsheet: renewals get missed, invoices are typed by hand, payments are matched by reading bank statements, and nobody can say how much recurring revenue the company has. This system runs the whole subscription month in one place, from a new customer signing up to the finance lead's numbers. The full breakdown is in [docs/requirements.md](docs/requirements.md).

## Features

- Add staff-only paginated payment search with combined method/date/text filters and invoice links. (PS-21).

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19, Vite, React Router, Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Backend | Node.js, Express 5, organized into modules |
| Database | **PostgreSQL** (local) with the Prisma ORM |
| Validation | Zod on the server, with matching rules on the client |
| Auth | JWT and bcrypt |
| Live updates | Server-Sent Events |

Everything runs locally. There is no hosted database or backend service, and no third-party API in the core flow.

## Database

Database design is the heart of this project. [docs/data-model.md](docs/data-model.md) has the full documentation: the design decisions, ER diagram, every table and column, the check constraints that protect the data, and how each hard rule is guaranteed.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20.19 or later (or 22.12 or later), PostgreSQL 14 or later, and Git.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jasilmeledath/odoo-hackathon-2026.git
   ```

   ```bash
   cd odoo-hackathon-2026
   ```

2. Create the database:

   ```bash
   createdb brightloop_subscriptions
   ```

3. Set up the server:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `server/.env`: set `DATABASE_URL` to your PostgreSQL user and password, and `JWT_SECRET` to a long random string.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   ```

   ```bash
   npm run db:seed
   ```

4. Start the API on port 4000:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. In a second terminal, start the client from the repository root:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

Without SMTP settings in `server/.env`, emails such as password reset links are printed in the server terminal.

## Demo logins

Every account uses the password `Demo@12345`.

| Role | Email |
|---|---|
| Admin | `admin@demo.test` |
| Internal staff | `staff@demo.test` |
| Internal staff | `finance@demo.test` |
| Customer | `customer@demo.test` |
| Customer | `customer2@demo.test` |

```

## Checks

From `server/`, run `npm test` for billing and catalog validation regressions.
The test runner uses the same tsx loader as the API for generated Prisma enums.
From `client/`, run `npm run build` to check the frontend.

## API

See [docs/api.md](docs/api.md).
